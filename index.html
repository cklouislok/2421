<h1>Optimizing Tree Planting for the Green Future of Peterborough</h1>

<div class = "aboutustext">  <!--Follow class "aboutustext" css-->
	<h2>Project Abstract</h2>  <!--Subtitle-->
	<p>
		Recognizing the significance of trees in harvesting numerous ecological benefits and combating climate change, 
		the City of Peterborough has set a target to expand the overall tree canopy coverage to 35% by 2051. To this end, 
		it is crucial to identify suitable areas in the city for tree planting, known as potential planting areas. 
		This insight supports the decision-making process in selecting tree species to plant in specific locations and 
		facilitates knowledge transfer especially to the wider public. As a result, the primary objective of this project 
		is to generate high-quality potential planting area data; the secondary objectives are to create a tree species 
		recommendation tool for office staff use and a web map of tree inventory for public use.
	</p>
	<p>
		In support of the City's canopy goal and urban forest management strategies, the CENGIS Team proposed three 
		deliverables: 
		(1) Classifying and analyzing the potential planting areas in the City using multiple data sources, 
		including vector data, LiDAR Data, and aerial imagery, through a series of spatial analyses; 
		(2) Creating a web mapping application which recommends tree species based on specific potential planting area 
		location in terms of proximity to various obstacles and geographic characteristics; and 
		(3) Creating a user-friendly web map of tree inventory and tree zone summary statistics for the general public.

			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>
				In the view of the significance of the ecological benefits provided by urban trees on its public
				and private lands, the City aimed to achieve a goal of overal tree canopy coverage of 35% by 2051. 
				This goal requires a reliable workflow to identify potential planting areas and to determine what 
				trees to plant. Public participation is also crucial considering the significance of tree planting 
				over privately owned lands.
