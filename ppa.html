	<h1>Spatial Analysis of Potential Planting Areas</h1>  <!--Title-->

	<p>
		In order to achieve the goal of overal tree canopy cover of 35% by 2051, it is of utmost importance to understand
		and visualize the potentially suitable tree planting areas to make informed decision about tree planting. The goal 
		of the team is to accurately identify potential planting areas in the City of Peterborough with detailed delineation
		of geographic attributes.
	</p>
	<p>
		A series of spatial analyses were performed to generate layers of potential planting areas.
	</p>
	<h2>GIS Software</h2>
	<p>
		ArcGIS Pro is the primary GIS software used.
	</p>

			<h2 class="leftalign">Data Used in Spatial Analysis</h2>
			<p>
				Three major types of spatial data were used in the spatial anaylsis of Potential Planting Areas:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Vector Data</li>
				<li>LiDAR Data</li>
				<li>Georeferenced Aerial Imagery</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Selected above-ground and underground utilities, infrastructure and physical structures, which 
				prohibit tree planting in a location, were identified and defined as conflicts. Some examples are 
				overhead powerlines, roads, existing trees, streetlights, hydrants, sanitary systems, storm management 
				systems, etc.

				The major analysis phases are as follows:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Reprojecting data</li>
				<li>Clipping to study area extent</li>
				<li>Extract a suitable base layer for further analysis</li>
				<li>Creating buffered areas for selected above-ground and underground conflicts</li>
				<li>Erasing conflicts from the base layer</li>
				<li>Classifying land ownership</li>

			<p>
				Alongside the spatial analysis, a series of models were created within a custom toolbox in ArcGIS Pro
				to record the complete workflow and geoprocessing tools used for data preprocessing, data processing, 
				and spatial analysis. The toolbox and models allow the client to rerun the PPA analysis with new datasets
				in the future as needed.

				Features within the resulting potential planting area layers have a wide range of attributes about
				land ownership, suitablility for tree sizes, salt spray tolerance, and zoning information.

	<h2>What's Next?</h2>  <!--Subtitle-->
	<p>
		The resulting potential planting area layers would serve as an updated baseline study on the extent of available 
		planting sites within the city boundaries. They would also be the stepping stone for the client to develop tree 
		planting programs. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition, the potential planting area layers were combined with a tree species database in an interactive 
		web mapping application. That application suggest the most suitable tree species to plant when a potential planting
		area is selected. Check it out <a href="tree_suggestion.html">here</a>!
