			<p>
				The target user of this application was the staff of the City of Peterborough. 
				They might be arborists, town planners, GIS department technicians, etc. 
				responsible for tree planting planning. Therefore, the layout of the application 
				was functional and simple to use. The map was placed in the center of the application. 
				Different interaction tools surrounded it. The analysis tools were divided into two 
				categories. They were Single PPA Analysis Tools and Batch PPAs Analysis Tools respectively.

			<p>
				i.	Information and Tree Species Suggestion for Single PPA <br>
Users selected a single PPA with the cursor. The application returned the PPA 
information in the feature info. widget and suggested suitable planting tree 
species for selected PPA in the table.

				ii.	Check Overhead Powerline<br>
Users can check if the selected PPA intersected with the overhead powerline by using the Query widget. 
The setting was default. Users just click the apply button to conduct the intersect analysis. 
The application returned overhead power information and changed the colour of the powerline from pink to purple. 
It helped the user to identify the segment of the powerline.

				iii.	Batch PPAs analysis tool <br>Point or polygon PPAs selection tool 
				can be used to define the interesting area. Buffer area can also be 
				adjusted by user. The application returned the summary of the selected 
				PPA and updated table information automatically. Users can click the 
				export button to export the data in CSV format. This tool helped planners 
				or arborists to analyze a large area of PPAs.

				iv.	Add Data <br>
				The application allowed users to add more data to the map. 
				Data from the City of Peterborough AGOL portal can be imported. 
				For example, the park feature layer. In addition, data formats 
				such as CSV, Shapefile, KML, etc, can be added. It enhanced the 
				flexibility of the data import. The below demonstration showed 
				adding a development planning boundary in the map and looking 
				for the PPAs intersecting with the project area.

			<h2 class="leftalign">Methodology</h2>
			<p>
				Experience Builder (EB) was applied to create a web mapping application for client 
				frontline staff to find out PPAs and suggest suitable tree species for selected PPAs. 
				This application was built in the ArcGIS Online (AGOL) of the City of Peterborough. 
				The application was only shared with authorized staff with the organizational portal 
				account. It ensured that sensitive information would not be accessed by unauthorized people.

				The PPA layer was obtained from the deliverable one. According to the classification criteria, 
				all PPAs were classified into 1-9 conditions. In addition, a Tree Species Table was built for 
				PPA suitable tree recommendation. There were 13 fields in the table.  It recorded the suitable 
				tree species for 1-9 conditions. The two tables were linked with the condition field. 
				<br>
				Then the PPA layer, suitable tree recommendation table, and powerline layer were uploaded to 
				Web Map and EB was used to create the web mapping application.
